    text: So you're here! It means you have spent your money on my software (I suppose),
      imported it into your project and you're ready to use. I'm glad that you did
      and I hope you find this tool quite useful. You'll find starter infos you need
      below. If you need more, kindly go to Online Documentation.

  - heading: Setup for Interactor
    text: "No need to worry about the setup because Interactor needs almost nothing
      to change in your project. \n\n1 - Add \"Player\" layer to your Layers (Top
      right corner of the Unity). This is for preventing conflicts while spawning
      new prefabs and selecting distant objects with raycasts. \n\nThat's all!"

  - heading: Integrations and Examples
    text: "Currently, there are two versions of Interactor. When you import, it comes
      with DefaultPack (Unity IK) and you can convert between DefaultPack and FikPack
      (Final IK integration) on the Interactor component at any time. If you want
      to switch, add Interactor to any scene object and select at Integrations section
      on the added component. \n\nInteractor comes with default 1K textures because
      of file sizes. If you want to use 4K versions, you can download and import the
      4K texture pack. Just import the pack and it's done without any tweaks. "

  - heading: QuickStart
    text: "I strongly suggest you examine the Example Scenes first if you didn't yet.
      There are samples for every interaction type with additional info. Also, there
      are lots of comments on codes and tooltips on components to explain most of
      the things. \n\nHere is a quick guide for testing your first interactions with
      your own character: \n\n1- Add Interactor to the player character (It will also
      add sphere collider). \n\n2- Set sphere collider as a trigger. \n\n3- Click
      Start Interactor button and it will add your first Effector after you save your
      data file. \n\n4- Effectors are like interaction sensors (one for each interactable
      player part). Add many as you need ([ + ] [ - ] buttons), select Effector Type
      and press the Auto button.\n\n5- Add InteractorIK component to your character.
      Set your IK Parts for each interactable body part. And enable Match Child Bones.
      \n\n6- Add BasicUI.cs and BasicInputInteract.cs to your Player (Same place with
      Interactor). \n\n7- Put your player to ExampleScenes and try interactions. If
      you have issues check the possible reasons in Troubleshoot section. "

    text: "If you're satisfied and want to support this tool, I'd appreciate it if
      you leave ratings & comments on the store page. Your reviews significantly increase
      the time I can focus on Interactor instead of doing other freelance projects
      to make a living. If you're not satisfied, reach me and I'll do my best to help.
      Thank you. \n\nI wish you all the best in your projects!\n-Gokhan Yilmaz"
